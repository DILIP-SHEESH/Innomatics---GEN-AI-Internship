## 💡 Business Logic

### 💰 Fee Calculation

Membership cost is calculated based on:

* **10% discount** → for duration ≥ 6 months
* **20% discount** → for duration ≥ 12 months
* **Extra 5% discount** → if referral code is used
* **₹200 processing fee** → for EMI payments

---

### 📊 Example Fee Breakdown

```json
{
  "base_price": 8980,
  "duration_discount": 0.2,
  "referral_discount": 0.05,
  "processing_fee": 200,
  "total": 7184
}
```

---

## ⚠️ Validations

* `member_name` → minimum 2 characters
* `phone` → minimum 10 digits
* `plan_id` → must be valid
* Duplicate plan names are not allowed
* Cannot delete plan with active memberships
* Class booking allowed only if:

  * Membership is active
  * Plan includes classes

---
